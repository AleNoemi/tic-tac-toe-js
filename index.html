		<h1 class="main-header">Tic-Tac-Toe.js: redux pattern in plain javascript</h1>
		<p>There's this thing going on in the Front-End Developement community where everybody wants to re-write their applications to use React. Sorry to disapoint, but that's not the case here. At work I mostly use vanilla javascript, therefore it is more beneficial for me learning the concepts rather than the frameworks themselves.</p>
		<p>With the amazing help and guidance of <a href="https://github.com/ricardobeat">@ricardobeat</a>, I've managed to build this <a href="https://rocky-ocean-52527.herokuapp.com/">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> game using Redux principles exclusively with vanilla javascript. That's it, no React, no jQuery, no micro-library, it doesn't rely on anything else. It's just plain js. What? Is it really possible? Yes, and that's what I wanna share in this post. Let's get into the details.</p>
		<h2 class="sub-header">The key principles</h2>
		<p>Redux pattern is mainly based on <a href="http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html">three fundamental principles</a>:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Single source of truth</strong>
				<p>The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">State is read-only</strong>
				<p>The only way to mutate the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.</p></li>
			<li><strong class="highlight">Changes are made with pure functions</strong>
				<p>To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 class="sub-header">How does it look like on Tic-Tac-Toe.js?</h2>
		<strong class="highlight">One single store</strong>
		<p class="mb-shorter">Everything that can affect UI is saved on <a href="https://github.com/ramonvictor/tic-tac-toe-js/blob/master/src/store.js">store.js</a>. Check how the structure looks like:</p>

		</div>

		<strong class="highlight"><a href="https://github.com/ramonvictor/tic-tac-toe-js/blob/master/src/game.js">Game.js</a> dispatches actions whenever needed:</strong>
		<p class="mb-shorter">Let's check what happens, for instance, when user clicks on the table grid:</p>

		</div>

		<strong class="highlight">Reducers receive actions and return new state</strong>
		<p class="mb-shorter">It's also possible to combine multiple reducers.</p>
		<div class="snippet-wrapper">

		<h2 class="sub-header">Strict unidirectional data flow</h2>
		<p>TODO!!!</p>
		<p><a href="http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/DataFlow.html">See more on official documentation.</a></p>

		<h2 class="sub-header">How about the back-end?</h2>
		<p>This was one of the coolest things about Redux. Since everything is based on dispatch actions, which are by definition simple JSON objects, it was quite easy to make Tic-Tac-Toe.js a multiplayer game.</p>
		<p>Node.js was obviously my choice. With just a few lines of code I could make a broadcast service on the backend. It also handles room ids and everything. Works like a charm! :)</p>
